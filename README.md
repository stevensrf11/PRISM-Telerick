Brian Lagunas Building IG Outlook using telerik
I am following along with Brian Lagunas video series on Prism.
I am replacing the Infragistic controls he uses with Telerik controls.
I have completed Part 5 of the video:
Building IG Outlook Part 5 - Implementing Navigation and a little MVVM
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSwubHHxEtk

In the video navigation to a new view via Prism occurs at start up and when an outlook bar item is selected an Infragistics Outlook bar.
In the code I modified replacing the Infragistics Outlook Bar with Telerik WPF RadOutlookBar navigation to a new view only occurs the first time a RadOutlookBar item is selected, 
and up start up. Navigation to a new view never occurs again when a RadOutlookBar Item is selected.

Feel free to download the code modify, improve,and fix it if you can.
THen email me back the files changed and I will update this code.
The goal here to get a fully functional Building IG Outlook using Telerik controls in place of infragistic code.
There is still a video 6 in the series to yet finish.
